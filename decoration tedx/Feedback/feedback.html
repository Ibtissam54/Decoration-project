         <p>This filling cabinet was well-worth the money i paid for it.
             the only drawback was fedEx delivered it to the wrong address,not the correct address that was on the package.
             I thank God for honest neighbors.
             way fair needs consider using another besides FedEx to deliver their products.</p>

        <p>I have been searching for a reasonably priced filling cabinet for months now and I stumbled upon this one.
            The delivery went smoothly in that fedEXleft it by my porch steps and it arrived quite quickly,before the estimated delivery date.
            I had trouble getting it up my front steps since it was quite heavy but I did it using a dolly for the porch steps and the 2 steps going downstairs.the item was packaged very well and there  were little dents on oneside of the cabient but who known I could have done that while trying to move it up mt concrete steps.No one will see the dents.
            The drawers glide smoothly and it comes with 2 keys in case you  want to keep the cabinet locked.
             I used letter sized hanging folders and they fit perfectly.
             I store this in a closet in my office room and so far I really like this cabinet it was much better than using stackable crates which made it very difficult to file my house paperwork.</p></div>
